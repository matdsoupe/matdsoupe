# <img align="center" src="./assets/eevee.png" height="75px" /> welcome, dear

## who am i?

a travesty üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è software engineer, open-source maintainer, and passionate functional programming enthusiast.  

i craft scalable backend systems with **elixir**, blending abstraction and pragmatism to solve real-world problems. my career has centered on **fintech solutions**, where ideas like **pix**, **drex**, and **open finance** inspire me to build reliable and accessible financial tools.  

beyond work, i'm drawn to the elegance of **category theory** and **abstract algebra**, finding joy in understanding the structures that underpin computation. i'm deeply connected to the **elixir community**, contributing open-source tools and creating spaces for learning, sharing, and collaboration.  

my projects reflect what i value: developer tooling, interactive learning platforms, and systems built with clarity and intention.  

minimalism, abstraction, and community guide everything i do.
